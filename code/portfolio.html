    About Me
    I am a junior web developer with a strong motivation to develop my professional skills as wellas  create effective and unique designs. I am looking forward to building my scope of knowledge and learning as much as I can while I grow as a web developer.
    I am graduate from Conestoga college in Embedded Systems Development program, and a BTech graduate in Electronics and communication engineering. I have had a strong interest in programming since I was thirteen, having dabbled in a few languages over the course of my education & career. I love working on both the back-end (with Node JS & Express) and the front-end (with React JS & jQuery). I am also very interested in neural networks and machine learning. My skills and abilities match the position requirements that you seek. 
    In addition, I have outstanding written and communication skills, and a good team leader and secured employee of the month in my previous job as cashier. As you will note from my résumé, I have experience in customer service, handling cash, accounting and an excellent work ethic and reliability record.
